# 12-Tone Matrix Generator

## Description
The goal for this project was to create a compositional tool (12-tone matrix) that enables composers to create 12-tone music.
This project enabled me to practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It also allowed me to practice designing user interfaces, writing code that meets accessibility requirements, refactor and simplify large amounts of code, and create responsive web pages.
