        <h2>Who Invented It?</h2>
        <div class="who-container">
            <p>Invented by 20th century comopser Arnold Schoenberg, the 12-tone matrix is a compositional tool used by composers to
                produce 12-tone music.  The technique's purpose is to ensure that the consequent music is atonal, meaning that no 
                particular pitch occurs more frequently than another and there is no perceptible key. It serves to emphasize the 
                intervallic relationships created by the composer's matrix rather than relying on the intervallic relationships 
                present in tranditional tonal music. 12-tone music is considered a form of serialization and therefore relies on the very 
                particular ordering of the 12 pitches in the octave. It also relies on the notion of octave equivalence, meaning that the
                pitches within different octaves are considered equivalent.

        <h2>The 12-Tone Row:</h2>
        <div class="the-row-container">
            <div class="transformation-instructions-container">
                <p> The 12-tone matrix is based upon a single 12-tone row.  
                    This is an ordered sequence of the 12 pitches present in an octave. 
                    Twelve tone rows are typically created with very particular intervallic relationships in mind.
                    The 12-tone matrix shows all of the possible transformations of a particular row. 
                    These transformations are then used to create 12-tone music.  
                    There are four possible transformations that can be performed on a row:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Transposition: Each note in the row is moved up or down by a consistent interval.  
                        The intervallic relationships between the notes of the row are preserved. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inversion: The intervals between each note in the row are reversed.  
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Retrograde: The notes of the row are reversed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Retrograde Inversion: The row is inverted and then reversed.
                    </li>

                <p>The adjacent diagram shows the 12-tone matrix along with all of the possible row transormations. 
                    The procedure for making a 12-tone matrix by hand is as follows: 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Make your prime row the first row of the matrix.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Populate the first column of the matrix by calculating the inversion of the prime row.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Populate the remaining rows of the matrix by transposing the row according to the first note populated in step two.
