        <h2>Who Invented It?</h2>
        <div class="who-container">
            <p>Invented by 20th century comopser Arnold Schoenberg, the 12-tone matrix is a compositional tool used by composers to
                produce 12-tone music. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span> The technique's purpose is to ensure that the consequent music is atonal, meaning that no 
                particular pitch occurs more frequently than another and there is no perceptible key. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span> It serves to emphasize the 
                intervallic relationships created by the composer's matrix rather than relying on the intervallic relationships 
                present in tranditional tonal music. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span> 12-tone music is considered a form of serialization and therefore relies on the very 
                particular ordering of the 12 pitches in the octave. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span> It also relies on the notion of octave equivalence, meaning that the
                pitches within different octaves are considered equivalent. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span>

            <div class="transformation-instructions-container">
                <p> The 12-tone matrix is based upon a single 12-tone row. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span> 
                    This is an ordered sequence of the 12 pitches present in an octave. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span> 
                    Twelve tone rows are typically created with very particular intervallic relationships in mind. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span>
                    The 12-tone matrix shows all of the possible transformations of a particular row. 
                    These transformations are then used to create 12-tone music.  <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span>
                    There are four possible transformations that can be performed on a row:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Transposition: Each note in the row is moved up or down by a consistent interval.  
                        The intervallic relationships between the notes of the row are preserved. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span> 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Inversion: The intervals between each note in the row are reversed. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Retrograde: The notes of the row are reversed. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Retrograde Inversion: The row is inverted and then reversed. <span>("Twelve-tone technique")</span>
